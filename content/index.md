My name is Viktor (Victor/[epo] Viktoro, sed vi povas nomi min Venkinto) [he/him]. I am Russian student. I speak Russian ([native](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language)), English ([~Upper Intermediate](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-levels)), German ([>Anfanger (A1-A2)](https://www.goethe.de/ins/in/de/spr/kon/stu.html)) and a little bit Esperanto.

You can contact me via [Telegram](https://t.me/Grey31) or [Email](mailto:mail@arbuz.icu).

I enjoy studying and I believe it will help me achieve all my goals. <br></br>
I think I am good at IT, Economics and [Maths](https://www.thesaurus.com/e/grammar/math-vs-maths/#:~:text=Math%20is%20the%20preferred%20term,places%20while%20maths%20was%20elsewhere.) <br></br>
I am also interested in Geography and Physics. <br></br>

I consider my <strong>My main goal to make our world a much better, safer and easier place for everyone.</strong><br>
