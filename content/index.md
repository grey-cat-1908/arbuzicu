# Hi! This is my homepage!

This is my personal website. I do experiments, publish projects and articles here. 

## About me

My name is Viktor. I am student from Moscow.

I enjoy studying and I believe it will help me achieve all my goals.
I think I am good at IT, Economics and [Maths](https://www.thesaurus.com/e/grammar/math-vs-maths/#:~:text=Math%20is%20the%20preferred%20term,places%20while%20maths%20was%20elsewhere.).
I am also interested in Geography, Linguistics.

I participate in numerous Olympiads and competitions, making this topic both close and fascinating to me. I am always ready to engage in a conversation about it.

I enjoy creating and developing projects, conducting experiments, and publishing information about them on this website. 

I am always trying to utilize all areas of interest in my projects in order to realize zen and improve my skills.
You can find information about some of my public projects on this website ("Projects" section).

You can contact me via [Telegram](https://t.me/Grey31) or [Email](https://arbuz.icu/mail). 

I speak Russian ([native](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language)), English ([~Upper Intermediate](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-levels)). Also I understand a little German ([>Anfanger (A2)](https://www.goethe.de/ins/ru/de/spr/kon/stu.html)) and Esperanto.

If you speak Russian and you are interested in me, I can recommend you to read my [Telegram channel](https://t.me/marakarka). Otherwise, you can read "Arbuz Journal" on this website.
