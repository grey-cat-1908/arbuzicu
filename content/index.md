# Hi! This is my homepage!

My name is Viktor. I am student from Moscow. I speak Russian ([native](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language)), English ([~Upper Intermediate](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-levels)), German ([>Anfanger (A2)](https://www.goethe.de/ins/ru/de/spr/kon/stu.html)) and a little bit Esperanto.


I enjoy studying and I believe it will help me achieve all my goals.
I think I am good at IT, Economics and [Maths](https://www.thesaurus.com/e/grammar/math-vs-maths/#:~:text=Math%20is%20the%20preferred%20term,places%20while%20maths%20was%20elsewhere.).
I am also interested in Geography, Linguistics and Physics.

I participate in numerous Olympiads and competitions, making this topic both close and fascinating to me. I am always ready to engage in a conversation about it.

I enjoy creating and developing projects, conducting experiments, and publishing information about them on this website. 

I am always trying to utilize all areas of interest in my projects in order to realize zen and improve my skills.
You can find information about some of my public projects on this website ("Projects" section).


I consider **my main goal to make our world a much better, safer and easier place for everyone.**
