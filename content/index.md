# Hi! This is my homepage!

My name is Viktor. I am student from Moscow. I speak Russian ([native](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language)), English ([~Upper Intermediate](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-levels)), German ([>Anfanger (A2)](https://www.goethe.de/ins/ru/de/spr/kon/stu.html)) and Esperanto.


I enjoy studying and I believe it will help me achieve all my goals.
I think I am good at IT, Economics and [Maths](https://www.thesaurus.com/e/grammar/math-vs-maths/#:~:text=Math%20is%20the%20preferred%20term,places%20while%20maths%20was%20elsewhere.).
I am also interested in Geography, Linguistics and Physics.


I am always trying to utilize all areas of interest in my projects in order to realize zen and improve my skills.
You can find information about some of my public projects on this website ("Projects" section).


I consider **my main goal to make our world a much better, safer and easier place for everyone.**
