## My Projects

I have a lot of projects, but there list of most popular (were/are/will be) and which are being maintained.

* [Melisa](https://github.com/MelisaDev/melisa) - Discord API Python wrapper. A module I created to improve my skills and help other people.
  
* [boticordpy](https://github.com/boticord/boticordpy) - BotiCord API Python wrapper. I made it for my friend's project, but it is still being used by some newbies.
